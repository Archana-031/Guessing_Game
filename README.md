# Guessing_Game

This project features a guessing game implemented in both a web-based environment (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and a console-based application (C). The game allows players to guess a randomly generated number and provides feedback based on their guesses. The web version includes options to play with a limited number of attempts or with unlimited attempts, while the C version provides similar functionality in a console environment.
